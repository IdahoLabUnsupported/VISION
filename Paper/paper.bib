title = "A modern transmutation library database of nuclear fuel cycle reactor stage performance information",
abstract = "The U.S. Department of Energy has developed a variety of nuclear fuel cycle performance data using detailed simulations of nuclear fuel cycle reactor stage performance information. Key examples include the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening (E&S) study and a legacy Transmutation Data Library (TDL) for dynamic fuel cycle simulation. The E&S study and the TDL contain information from over 600 different fuel cycle option reactor stages. This information is stored in the form of Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, and text files. In support of the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE) Office of Nuclear Technology Research and Development's System Analysis and Integration Campaign (previously known as the Fuel Cycle Options Campaign), this data was collected and imported into a MySQL database using modern software development best practices. We describe why this was conducted, the process for implementation, the verification of the data, and how this increases accessibility and functionality of this data to users and stakeholders. We also identify some of the interfaces and applications, including dynamic fuel cycle simulators that can be coupled to this database and potential future work.",
